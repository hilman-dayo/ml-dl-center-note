NOTE ON LAYER IN NN -*- mode:org -*-

TODO: Make your own library to understand basic CNN.
* About layer
  - consists of group of nodes that can map input to output nonlinearly
  - besides the input layer, every layer essentially is a group of activation
    functions (layers are functions)
  - when a layer is 'learning':
    - the functions minimize error by adjusting the parameters that they own
